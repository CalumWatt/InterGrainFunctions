# NVTconvert

## NVTconvert was developed for the sole purpose of making Allan Rattey's life easier.

This package creates trial designs based on user defined crop species (i.e. wheat) and crop sub-types (i.e. Durum). NVTconvert uses ggplot2 to visualise each specific trial in Range x Row layout and the function creates trial specific .jpeg files.
